     <p> <b> Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in</b> <i>terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page</i> long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</p>
