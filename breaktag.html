        <p> Hey <br>

           <b> Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in </b>         
           <i>terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is</i>
            half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of 
            ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. </p>
